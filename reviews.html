                    Missing something
                    I've been here a couple times before and had no issues with food. This time round, the chicken biryani and kachumbari, though beautifully presented, were not fresh and even had a stale smell. The food lacked the spicy Swahili flavors. At some point I suspected that the biryani gravy may have been reheated leftovers. Furthermore, they have increased their prices by a big margin. Was very disappointed with this experience and will definitely look for somewhere else where I can enjoy a decent coastal meal.

                   Swahili Plate at Prestige Plaza, Ngong Road
                   Apparently there is another Swahili Plate at Adams Arcade on the Ngong Road. I walked in here as the irresistible aroma wafted around and ordered my first Ethiopian dish. The beef sauce was excellent. I didn't particularly love the millet bread but it was good enough for my first experience.
                   The service by the waiter was excellent and left me impressed. I had wanted to try the mixed sauce (large platter) but as I was alone he advised it would be too much for an individual.
                   My next visit will definitely be with a friend so that we can try the mixed sauce.

                    The Waiting Thieves of Nairobi
                    So I came here to eat something small, and I had put my fancy upon the ice cream (single coupe 200 kes, double coupe 300). Unfortunately the waiter serving me told me a double coupe costed 400kes. What! Why was he lying to me! Terrible! Even though the food itself looked good, and I was very hungry, I left the place immediately. Be careful for such waiting thieves; and beware the homeless street boys on the street: if you don't give them money they grab their knives.

                        Good food but very oily
                        My local friends brought me here and said it was one of their favourites. They said their meals the day we visited were disappointing and that the food usually wasn't so oily but on this day it was too oily that neither of them could eat all their food. That said the food was still quite tasty.
