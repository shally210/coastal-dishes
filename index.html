                   <!---- <p>These sweet crusty dumplings are probably one of the most recognisable Swahili cuisines.<br>
                     If you take a stroll down in Mombasa or coastal villages in other towns in the country, you are likely to find kaimatis being prepared in roadside kiosks. They are also some of the most popular Swahili snacks during Ramadan. READ ALSO: How to make mahamri: a simple and delicious recipe Ingredients To prepare kaimati, you need: 1 cup of flour ½ cup of sour milk 1 tablespoon of butter 1 teaspoon of baking soda or yeast ½ cup of sugar ½ of water ½ cup of cardamom powder (feel free to choose any flavour of choice) 2 litres of liquid sunflower or corn cooking oil 1 cup of icing sugar Instructions Image: youtube.com, @Vanessa Mehri, giphy.com (modified by author) Source: UGC Mix sugar with sour milk, butter, and water Simmer the syrup mixture to its maximum boiling point, then cool it down Pour the mixture in a bowl and add in flour and the rest of the ingredients Knead the dough mixture with your hand until it is thick enough to be rolled Cover and leave it for about 20-30 mins to rise Roll your dough into small rounded dumplings Heat the oil in a pan until it is hot then turn the heat to medium Carefully place in the dumplings one by one Make sure not to cramp many of them in the pan. Spacing allows enough space for each to cook both on the inside and outside. Leave them to fry until they are brown on all sides Once you are done cooking, drop your kaimatis into the icing sugar and spread it evenly on their surface

                   <!---- <p class="hidden">swahili pilau is a one of a kind dish that requires precision for you to get it right. However, if you ace it, you will switch your favourite from ugali nyama or any other dish and prepare pilau more often. Ingredients Wondering how to cook Swahili pilau? Well, you need: ½ kilo of beef 3 cups of rice 2 diced onions 2 tablespoons of pilau masala 1 tablespoon of salt 1 tablespoon of ginger paste 1 tablespoon of pepper 1 tablespoon of garlic 4 cloves ‘Karafuu’ 1 tablespoon of cinnamon powder Cooking oil READ ALSO: Chips masala recipe: add some flair to your potatoes for yourself Instructions Image: youtube.com, @Kaluhi's Kitchen, giphy.com (modified by author) Source: UGC Boil the meat until it is soft Remove the meat from the broth. Keep the broth aside Pour some cooking oil in a sufuria and heat Add diced onions and fry until they are golden brown. Add ginger paste and garlic to the oil. Let it cook for a minute then add the tender meat. Let it cook while stirring until the meat turns reddish-brown. Add pilau masala, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon and let them cook for about eight minutes. Pour in the broth that you set aside in the second step, add some salt to taste and let it boil. If the broth isn’t enough to cook your rice, add some water. Wash your rice, rinse it and add to the cooking beef Cover the cooking point and cook at a low simmer Wait for all the water to evaporate and leave your pilau to cool

                    Missing something
                    I've been here a couple times before and had no issues with food. This time round, the chicken biryani and kachumbari, though beautifully presented, were not fresh and even had a stale smell. The food lacked the spicy Swahili flavors. At some point I suspected that the biryani gravy may have been reheated leftovers. Furthermore, they have increased their prices by a big margin. Was very disappointed with this experience and will definitely look for somewhere else where I can enjoy a decent coastal meal.

                   Swahili Plate at Prestige Plaza, Ngong Road
                   Apparently there is another Swahili Plate at Adams Arcade on the Ngong Road. I walked in here as the irresistible aroma wafted around and ordered my first Ethiopian dish. The beef sauce was excellent. I didn't particularly love the millet bread but it was good enough for my first experience.
                   The service by the waiter was excellent and left me impressed. I had wanted to try the mixed sauce (large platter) but as I was alone he advised it would be too much for an individual.
                   My next visit will definitely be with a friend so that we can try the mixed sauce.

                    The Waiting Thieves of Nairobi
                    So I came here to eat something small, and I had put my fancy upon the ice cream (single coupe 200 kes, double coupe 300). Unfortunately the waiter serving me told me a double coupe costed 400kes. What! Why was he lying to me! Terrible! Even though the food itself looked good, and I was very hungry, I left the place immediately. Be careful for such waiting thieves; and beware the homeless street boys on the street: if you don't give them money they grab their knives.

                        Good food but very oily
                        My local friends brought me here and said it was one of their favourites. They said their meals the day we visited were disappointing and that the food usually wasn't so oily but on this day it was too oily that neither of them could eat all their food. That said the food was still quite tasty.
